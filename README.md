# Vampire Survivor-Esque Game

A Unity-based 2D action survival game inspired by *Vampire Survivors*, built to explore game mechanics, procedural enemies, and player progression systems. This project demonstrates practical skills in C#, Unity development, and game design.

## üéÆ About the Game

In this game, players control a character that automatically attacks enemies while trying to survive increasingly difficult waves. The game emphasizes:
- **Automatic Combat**: Focus on movement and strategy while the character attacks on its own.
- **Progression System**: Unlock new abilities, weapons, and power-ups as you survive longer.
- **Procedural Enemy Waves**: Enemies spawn dynamically to provide varied challenges.
- **2D Pixel Art Style**: Simple, clean graphics for clarity and gameplay focus.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies & Tools

- **Unity 2021+**: Primary game engine.
- **C#**: Game logic, player and enemy behavior scripting.
- **ShaderLab & HLSL**: Custom shaders for visual effects.
- **Git & GitHub**: Version control and collaboration.
